The Quiz App is an interactive, responsive web application designed to challenge usersâ€™ knowledge across a wide range of topics including Science, General Knowledge, History, Entertainment, and more. It was built using React and Tailwind CSS, with the goal of providing an engaging learning and self-assessment experience.

This project began as a frontend-focused exploration of how to create smooth, user-friendly quiz interfaces using modern React tools like React Router, custom animations, and interactive components. The UI emphasizes clean transitions, category selection, difficulty modes (easy, medium, hard), and a pop-up-based quiz flow to simulate an app-like experience on the web.

The questions used in this app are sourced from open APIs such as the Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB), which provides free and categorized trivia questions for public use.

The project is still in development, with planned improvements including score tracking, leaderboard integration, authentication, and backend data storage."# quiz-app"
